		<h1>Design and Style Guide</h1>
		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp; PixelBuffer and ColorData are used to process and display
			canvas, and IOManager module for reading and saving PixelBuffer is also
			necessary for building a painting application. In this suite, because all
			applications need StateManager to inspect and control the working sequence,
			StateManager module was also included in libimgtools library for common
			usage. Since all filters and tools are required for both Flashphoto and
			MIA, also the corresponding factories for tools and filters are important
			to create and use them, we also put all related header files and source
			files (including actual tools and filters code, factory and manager code)
			into the libimgtools library. These are necessary common parts required by
			both MIA, FlashPhoto.
		</p>

		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;We left the application frame code and GUI building functions in
			individual directory for each application because we consider that
			they are individual parts for different applications and this part of
			code depends on the actual requirements provided by customers and the
			specific implement way used by developers. So, we thought these parts of
			code is not suitable to put into libimgtools library.
		</p>

		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, we added CommandParsing into libimgtools since it supports
			almost all filters currently in the library. But some specific supporting
			codes still should be implemented in individual application frame code
			since different applications might use different sorts of filters. We
			cannot assume all application would use all filters and it may cause
			confusion if we do so. Command Parsing only provides an interface for
			the parsing results of the input command lines.
